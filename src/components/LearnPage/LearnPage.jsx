        At G Adventures, we don‚Äôt have tour guides ‚Äî we have Chief Experience Officers.
        Our founder, Bruce Poon Tip, gave up his title as CEO because he felt they needed a proper title to reflect how integral they are to giving you an exceptional travel experience.
        (But don‚Äôt worry, they won‚Äôt be using any office attire or business jargon.)

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Our CEOs are locally based, meaning they know the area you‚Äôre exploring like the back of their well-travelled hand.
        They plan visits around the best times to visit (or avoid) the most popular spots, can help you choose local restaurants, and generally give you great tips on the best things to experience.
        And since they usually speak the local language, they are your go-to resource for anything that comes up.

      <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-1">Local support. All. The. Time.</h4>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        All CEOs are supported by our local operations teams 24/7.
        If something comes up that your CEO can‚Äôt help you with (however unlikely that is), the team nearby is there to support them in keeping you safe and happy.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-1">Your experience is their focus.</h4>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        We want you to have the time of your life ‚Äî that‚Äôs why we hire the smartest, friendliest, bestest CEOs around.
        It‚Äôs their mission to make sure you return home feeling like your life has truly been changed.

        We‚Äôve been pioneers of community tourism since the day we started. But what is that? It means we have always
        created our tours by building meaningful relationships with local communities, directly benefiting the people
        and places we visit, including Indigenous peoples, women, youth ‚Äî anyone who has traditionally been marginalized
        or undervalued. Today, our definition has grown: the communities we impact ripples far beyond our destinations.
        To us, it includes our employees, supplier and agent partners, small business owners, customers, social followers,
        and travellers just like you. There's incredible power in being part of something bigger than yourself. Want in?
